 abstract = {The development of Calanus finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine (GOM), USA, and on Georges Bank (GB) was investigated during late fall, 1994, and winter, 1995, as part of the US-GLOBEC Georges Bank program. During November almost all of the C. finmarchicus population in both regions was present as C5, with a small proportion of C4 and females. There were very few animals on GB. In the southern GOM about a third of the C. finmarchicus population was in the upper 80 m and actively feeding; the remainder were below 120 m. On GB the C. finmarchicus population was also feeding; gut pigment content in both areas was between 3 and 13 ng copepod−1. About one third of the adult females on GB were reproductively active while none in the GOM were reproductively active. By January C. finmarchicus C6 females formed a large proportion of the older stage animals on the Bank and in surface waters of the southern GOM. These were actively feeding and reproducing with a large cohort of young nauplii of C. finmarchicus present in the southern GOM and smaller numbers on the northeast peak of the Bank. There were very few C. finmarchicus nauplii on the crest of the Bank or on the southern flank. Based on abundances and stage composition, it appeared that spawning began in late December and that repopulation of the Bank took place in the region of the NE peak, with nauplii and reproductively active females being transported onto this region of the Bank from the GOM.},

 abstract = {During mid-May–early June 1997 observations of hydrography, phytoplankton and nitrate concentrations, and abundance and stage distribution of Calanus finmarchicus populations were made in the Labrador Sea and south of Greenland. Egg production rates were also measured for isolated C. finmarchicus females. Surface nitrate and integrated phytoplankton concentrations indicated that, in the deep water, the phytoplankton bloom had ended in the north and east, was in progress in the north central Labrador Sea and near the basin margins, and had not yet become established in an area stretching from the central Labrador Sea to the south of Greenland. C. finmarchicus egg production rates and stage distributions at stations in the 3 areas designated as early, mid- and late/post-bloom zones, suggested that development rates of the overwintered G0 generation into mature adults (females and males) were probably low before the bloom, but accelerated during its development. Individual and areal rates of egg production were highest in the early bloom zone, whereas nauplii were more abundant in the bloom and late/post-bloom zones. Differences in naupliar abundance may have been related to food limitation, or predation. Following development through to the young copepodite stages (CI–III), which were most abundant in the late/post-bloom zone, morality rates were apparently lower and growth rates less dependent on high phytoplankton concentrations and perhaps more dependent on temperature. In the Labrador Sea, where the annual growth season is relatively short and C. finmarchicus produces only 1 generation per year, the timing of the spring bloom may have a significant impact on recruitment of the new year's generation. In areas where the bloom is early and intense, maturation of the overwintered adults will be rapid and egg-laying will occur when phytoplankton concentrations are high. Subsequent survival success of eggs through to later stages will also probably be relatively high and individuals from the new year's generation will have ample time to reach stages capable of overwintering. By contrast, if the bloom is late or of low intensity, adult maturation will be delayed and egg-laying may occur when phytoplankton concentrations are low. Under these conditions relatively few eggs may survive and individuals that do survive will have a shorter period in which to attain stages which can overwinter.},

The filtering capacity&lt;br&gt;decreased with decreasing prey organism size, so that greater than 95% of the available caloric content of the zooplankton samples was&lt;br&gt;captured in size fractions collected on 333m mesh nets.

Total zooplankton counts increased to above average levels in 1989 and stayed over or close to average through 2004. This analysis identified a group of taxa including Centropages typicus, Metridia lucens, and Temora longicornis that had similar interannual patterns of abundance. All these taxa increased sharply in the early 1990s and remained high through 2001. Some taxa declined sharply in 2002, others have continued elevated through 2004. Total zooplankton counts in the past two years were also boosted by a substantial increase in the abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Evidence is presented that these changes may be related to variations in Scotian Shelf inflow, which freshened water on the Northeast US continental shelf, perhaps increasing both primary production and the influx of zooplankton into the region. There was a positive correlation between the biomass of pelagic predators and the abundance of several zooplankton taxa, suggesting that bottom-up processes and advective supply are the key factors that regulate the Georges Bank foodweb.}",

    abstract = "{Kane, J. 2011. Multiyear variability of phytoplankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1833–1841.Significant interannual changes in phytoplankton abundance were identified in the Continuous Plankton Recorder time-series collected in the Gulf of Maine from 1961 to 2008. Abundance levels of nearly all the common taxa began to increase in 1990 and remained elevated through 2001. During that period, total numbers were above average throughout the year, with an unusual bloom in late summer. Multivariate analysis of abundance identified three consecutive multiyear periods of varying abundance levels: low to average from 1961 to 1989, above average or very high from 1990 to 2001, and below average thereafter, through 2008. Phytoplankton abundance patterns were closely aligned to the rising trends displayed by several of the common zooplankton taxa. The North Atlantic Oscillation was the only environmental variable examined that showed some association with time-series abundance trends of plankton. The index was primarily positive in the 1990s, which would favour the propagation of warm, nutrient-rich slope water into the region. Perhaps the increased influx of this water, along with feedback enrichment from abundant zooplankton stocks and reduced top-down control by the relative scarcity of the dominant copepod Calanus finmarchicus, combined with a low salinity to make the 1990s a unique decade for plankton change in the Gulf of Maine.}",

abstract = {We investigated regime shifts in seasonal zooplankton communities of the Northeast continental shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES) and its subcomponent ecoregions over a multi-decadal period (1977–2013). Our cross ecoregion analysis shows that regime shifts in different ecoregions often exhibited very distinct characteristics, emphasizing more granular fluctuations in NES plankton communities relative to previous work. Shifts early in the time series generally reflected an increase in abundance levels. The response of zooplankton abundance within fall communities was more similar among ecoregions than for spring communities. The Gulf of Maine exhibited highly distinct patterns from other ecoregions, with regime shifts identified in the early 1980s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s for spring communities. Regime shifts were identified in the early to mid-1990s for the NES, Georges Bank, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight ecoregions, while the fall communities experienced shifts in the early 1990s and late 1980s for the NES and Georges Bank, but in the late 1990s in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. A constrained correspondence analysis of zooplankton community against local and basin-scale climatological indices suggests that water temperature, stratification, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) were the predominant factors in driving the zooplankton community composition.}

We quantified interannual variation in anomalies of abundance and biomass of Calanus spp. and near-surface and near-bottom ocean temperature and salinity from 19 subregions spanning the Gulf of Maine–Georges Bank (GoM–GBK), Scotian Shelf (SS), Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) and Newfoundland and Labrador Shelves. We analyzed time series from 1977 to 2016 in GoM–GBK, 1982 to 2016 in southwest GSL and 1999 to 2016 in remaining areas. Calanus finmarchicus dominated abundance and biomass, except in the GSL where Calanus hyperboreus was abundant. The biomass of Calanus spp. declined in many subregions over years 1999–2016 and was negatively correlated with sea surface temperature in GoM–GBK and on the SS. We detected ``regime shifts” to lower biomass of Calanus spp. in the GoM–GBK in 2010 and on the SS in 2011. In the GoM–GBK, shifts to lower biomass of C. finmarchicus coincided with shifts to warmer ocean temperature and with published reports of changes in spatial distribution and reduced calving rate of NARW. We hypothesize that warming has negatively impacted population levels of Calanus spp. near their southern range limit, reducing the availability of prey to NARW.}",
