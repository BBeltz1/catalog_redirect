abstract = {Abstract Ocean acidification alters the oceanic carbonate system, increasing potential for ecological, economic, and cultural losses. Historically, productive coastal oceans lack vertically resolved high-resolution carbonate system measurements on time scales relevant to organism ecology and life history. The recent development of a deep ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET)-based pH sensor system integrated into a Slocum glider has provided a platform for achieving high-resolution carbonate system profiles. From May 2018 to November 2019, seasonal deployments of the pH glider were conducted in the central Mid-Atlantic Bight. Simultaneous measurements from the glider's pH and salinity sensors enabled the derivation of total alkalinity and calculation of other carbonate system parameters including aragonite saturation state. Carbonate system parameters were then mapped against other variables, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll, over space and time. The seasonal dynamics of carbonate chemistry presented here provide a baseline to begin identifying drivers of acidification in this vital economic zone.},

abstract = "In this study, we assessed the Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) energy budget under different ocean acidification conditions (OA). During 12weeks, 126 individuals were maintained at three different ﾏ，O2 concentrations. Every two weeks, individuals were sampled for physiological measurements and scope for growth (SFG). In the high ﾏ，O2 treatment, clearance rate decreased and excretion rate increased relative to the low ﾏ，O2 treatment, resulting in reduced SFG. Moreover, oxygen:nitrogen (O:N) excretion ratio dropped, suggesting that a switch in metabolic strategy occurred. The medium ﾏ，O2 treatment had no significant effects upon SFG; however, metabolic loss increased, suggesting a rise in energy expenditure. In addition, a significant increase in food selection efficiency was observed in the medium treatment, which could be a compensatory reaction to the metabolic over-costs. Results showed that surfclams are particularly sensitive to OA; however, the different compensatory mechanisms observed indicate that they are capable of some temporary resilience."
