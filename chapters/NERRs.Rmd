## Impact Summary

Data from the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) is used to explore certain water quality and climate indicators for four different stations in the New England area. The main goal of this project is to create a partially automated data workflow to aid in the visualization and ingestion of all the data available for each site to inform fisheries-based management while using open data science and principles.  This work can be found on github [rheganthomason/NERRSdata](https://github.com/rheganthomason/NERRSdata). 

###TEMPERATURE

The seasonality of temperature is very clear, with peaks in the summer and valleys in the winters. 2012 is recorded as the hottest year on record in the Northeast, and 2020 seems to be the runner-up to that. We observed Wells winter temperatures usually dropping to the 0-degree mark, but they barely got to 2 degrees in both 2012 and 2020. Narragansett is usually around 2 degrees but hits 3 - 4 degrees. Our main point here is that it is not getting cold enough in the winters. After evaluating our climatologies, we could see that the temperature averages of 2020 are higher than the overall average across 14 years of data, and even has the highest points in the entire series. These warmer temperatures are changing fisheries’ habitats, and a great example comes from the Wells site in Maine. They are currently seeing the implements of species that have never been observed there before. After the abnormally warm temperature period of 2012, the larval fish yields they collect annually suddenly had a majority of “marine migrant species,” and among those were the Chesapeake Blue Crab, and the Black Sea Bass. 

The black sea bass is commonly found below the cape, in warmer water, and because they were caught so far North, they are now being treated as potential climate change indicators.

###DISSOLVED OXYGEN

There is also a seasonal cycle in dissolved oxygen - cold water can hold more oxygen, and there is less respiration occurring when it is colder. Usually, the “danger zone”, where oxygen content is so low it becomes harmful, is around 2 milligrams per liter. Luckily, we did not observe any data dropping to that point, however, in late 2011 oxygen content in Great Bay did get close. The most devastating impact of low dissolved oxygen is anoxia, which is a complete deprivation of oxygen and is usually a death sentence for most animals involved. There were 2 events that took place very close to Narragansett Bay.  Greenwich Bay and Barrington. The Greenwich bay fish kill was the worst event in the last 50 - 100 years. Menhaden fish were hit the hardest, but crabs, eels, shrimp, and sea bass were also affected by this drop in oxygen. Millions of dead fish washed ashore, and the water was described as a “pea-soup green” The Barrington event took place just last august (2020), and around 5,000 dead fish washed ashore then.  


###SALINITY

Low salinity is the result of an influx of freshwater, from rain, or freshwater runoff and it is an Indicator of offshore water and high evaporation rates. If the data is completely out of the normal range, it could show a flooding event. We did observe a very low point in Narragansett, and it was, in fact, a flood. It was called the “great march flood of 2010” and as you can see in the pictures, it was a major event. From March 29 to 31, 6 to 10 inches of rain fell on Rhode Island, causing the rivers all around to overflow and take over highways, businesses, and homes. 

FEMA granted 79 million dollars in assistance for the communities affected. 
On the opposite side, droughts have another impact on salinity. Higher salinity leads to less freshwater and then droughts.  On October 13th, 2020, we found that Narragansett and Waquoit were experiencing droughts and through our data observed peaks in salinity.

## Methods

### Data Sources
All data were sourced from the Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO) http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/, the NERRS repository where all data is organized before being made available to the public. 

### Data Extraction
Four water quality parameters were explored (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, Salinity, Chlorophyll). This data was accessed from the Centralized Data Management Office and imported using the [SWMPr](https://github.com/fawda123/SWMPr) R package. 

Four National Estuarine Research Reserve Stations were compared from Rhode Island to Maine (Narragansett RI, Waquoit Bay MA, Great Bay NH, Wells ME). Each NERRs station has multiple sampling sites. With consultation from NERRs Station scientists, a single representative sampling site was chosen.  

```{r}
df<- data.frame(a = c("Narragansett Bay, RI", "Waquoit Bay, MA", "Great Bay, NH", "Wells Bay, ME"), 
                  b =  c("TWharf", "Metoxit Point", "Great Bay", "Inlet"),
                  c =  c("Kim Hyde", "Megan Tyrrell", "Chris Peter", "Jeremy Miller"))

kableExtra::kable(df, 
                  col.names = c("NERRs Station", "Sampling Site Chosen", "Expert Consulted"))
```

### Data Analysis
All data used was aggregated to month in order to handle days with missing data. 
The long-term time series average was calculated and compared to the most recent year of data (2020). They created a climatology that was used to identify years outside the normal range for that variable. 
 
### Data Processing
All data analysis and processing code are stored in GitHub [rheganthomason/NERRSdata](https://github.com/rheganthomason/NERRSdata).
