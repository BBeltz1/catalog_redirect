In 2021, IN FISH intern Ava De Leon (U. Miami) investigated diet data collected aboard the NEFSC bottom trawl survey 1973-2019 across all predators combined. 

Each category can be described in general:

**BENINV** includes prey that are clearly identifiable as benthic (bottom dwelling) invertebrates by either name or general taxoomic category. Similarly, **PELINV** includes prey clearly identifiable as pelagic (water column dwelling) invertebrates, including some shrimp species that spend much time in the water column.

**FISH** includes all fish, whether identified as individual species or as a taxonmic category, or “unidentified fish.” The FISH category also includes the commercially fished squid species, *Illex* and *Doryteuthis* (formerly *Loligo*).

**OTHER** includes everything that could not be placed into one of the above categories; for example, “unidentified invertebrates,” taxonomic categories that could be either benthic or pelagic, digested animal remains, plant material, etc.

In the Mid-Atlantic Bight in the Fall there were notable trends of increasing fish, and decreasing benthic invertebrates and pelagic invertebrates in predator diets. Other regions and seasons did not show significant diet trends. 


There was no significant trend in predator size over time for the Mid-Atlantic. The number of stomachs sampled from all predators combined has increased over time for both seasons and all regions. There isn’t one dominantly sampled predator over time, so it would be difficult to say that any single predator was driving the aggregate trends. The proportion of piscivores sampled was dominant for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and the proportion benthivores sampled has been higher and more consistent in all areas and seasons since about 2000.

### Raw data 
Data used in this work can be found in https://github.com/sgaichas/learnR-dietdata. 

## Methods
### Data Sources

These diet data were collected on the NEFSC bottom trawl survey 1973-2019. 

### Data Analysis

Trend analyses were performed on four prey categories, including benthic invertebrates, fish, pelagic invertebrates, and other in the regions of Georges Bank, Mid-Atlantic Bight and the Gulf of Maine during the Fall and Spring seasons. 

### Data Processing
Processed data can be found in the github repository for this project, [sgachias/learnR-dietdata](https://github.com/sgaichas/learnR-dietdata).
