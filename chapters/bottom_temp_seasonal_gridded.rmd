## Indroduction to Indicator
The bottom temperature product is in a horizontal 1/12 degree grid between 1959 and 2022 and is made of daily bottom temperature estimates from:

Bias-corrected ROMS-NWA between 1959 and 1992 which was regridded in the same 1/12degree grid as GLORYS using bilinear interpolation; Years 1993 through summer 2023 are from CMEMS GLORYS12V1 global reanalysis bottom temperature, and fall 2023 is from CMEMS PSY forecasting product.
