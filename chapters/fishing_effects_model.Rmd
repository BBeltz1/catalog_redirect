## Impact Summary

The Northeast Fishing Effects Model combines seafloor data (sediment type, energy regime) with fishing effort data and parameters related to the interactions between fishing gear and seafloor habitats to generate percent habitat disturbance estimates in space and time. The model domain extends north to south from the U.S./Canadian border to the N.C./S.C. border. The model differentiates six types of bottom-tending fishing gears: trawl, scallop dredge, clam dredge, longline, gillnet, and trap. Data inputs and outputs to Fishing Effects are gridded at a 5 km by 5 km resolution. The model outputs are monthly estimates of percent seabed habitat disturbance for each of these six gear types, by grid cell, from 1996-2017. The fishing effort spatial distributions (standardized as area swept in square kilometers) used for these model runs were generated using NEFSCâ€™s Fishing Footprints method (DePiper 2014, Benjamin et al. 2018) combined with gear width and length dimensions estimated from fishing observer data. In addition, model runs based on a uniform fishing effort distribution are used to estimate which locations have the highest intrinsic vulnerability to fishing impacts. These intrinsic vulnerability outputs are useful for estimating the potential for habitat impacts to occur in areas where certain types of fishing effort are prohibited by regulation. Additional information about the model can be found in NEFMC (2020) and in the report for the precursor to Fishing Effects, the Swept Area Seabed Impact (SASI) Model (NEFMC 2011). The SASI vulnerability assessment, which was applied to Fishing Effects with minor modifications, was published in Grabowski et al. 2014. Smeltz et al. (2019) details the North Pacific implementation of the model and provides additional background. Sediment data inputs and both types of model outputs are available via the Northeast Ocean Data Portal (https://www.northeastoceandata.org/data-explorer/, under Habitat). The data portal hosts selected outputs from the Northeast Fishing Effects Model which combines seafloor data (sediment type, energy regime) with fishing effort data to generate percent habitat disturbance estimates in space and time.
