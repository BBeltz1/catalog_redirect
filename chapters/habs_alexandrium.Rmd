## Methods
### Data Sources

Alexandrium cysts in sediments of the Gulf of Maine have been monitored through a cooperative effort of NOAA, WHOI, and other partners for over twenty years.  Sampling methods are described in Anderson et al. 2005.  In the annual survey cruises, samples are obtained with a Craib corer, and Alexandrium cysts are counted from the top 1- cm of sediment layer.

### Data Analysis

Alexandrium cysts in sediments of the Gulf of Maine have been monitored through a cooperative effort of NOAA, WHOI, and other partners for over twenty years.  Sampling methods are described in Anderson et al. 2005.  In the annual survey cruises, samples are obtained with a Craib corer, and Alexandrium cysts are counted from the top 1 cm of sediment layer.  Results are extrapolated from sampled area to estimate cyst abundance broader Gulf of Maine.

The spatial distribution and abundance of cyst cells from the annual survey are used to drive an ecosystem forecast model for the Gulf of Maine (Anderson et al. 2005, Li et al. 2009 & 2020,  McGillicuddy et al. 2011).  The model also many other inputs of dynamic oceanographic data such as currents, temperature, and nutrients.
