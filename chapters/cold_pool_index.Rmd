## Impact Summary

Changes in ocean temperature and circulation alter habitat features such as the cold pool, a 20–60 m thick band of cold, relatively uniform near‐bottom water that persists from spring to fall over the mid-shelf and outer shelf of the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) and Southern Flank of Georges Bank [@lentz_seasonal_2017]. The cold pool plays an essential role in the structuring of the MAB ecosystem.  It is a reservoir of nutrients that feeds phytoplankton productivity, is essential fish spawning and nursery habitat, and affects fish distribution and behavior [@lentz_seasonal_2017]. The average temperature of the cold pool has been getting warmer over time  [@miller_state-space_2016]).  These changes can affect distribution and migration timing for species that depend on the cold pool habitat.  The area of the MAB cold pool was near average in 2018 (Map below), the last complete year of the dataset.  The size of the cold pool varies annually, with the smallest sizes associated with record-warm years (e.g. 2012). The cold pool temperature shows a similar variation as its extent, both of which are strongly impacted by each early spring setting in temperature on the shelf.


### Plotted data 

The plot below was built using the code found
[here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-cold_pool.R). 

```{r ,  fig.cap = "Cold Pool Index", fig.align="center", eval=T, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, "/cold_pool_area.png"))
```

### Raw data 
The raw data is available in the [`ecodata` package](https://noaa-edab.github.io/ecodata/landing_page). 

```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(ecodata::cold_pool, options = list(pageLength = 10))
```


## Methods


### Data sources
NEFSC Hydrographic Database
This data represents the annual mean bottom temperature residual for Sept-Oct in the Mid-Atlantic Bight cold pool region from 1977-2018.

### Data extraction 


### Data analysis
Methods published @miller2016, [original MATLAB source code](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/tech-doc/tree/master/R/stored_scripts/cold_pool_analysis.txt) used in that paper was provided by Jon Hare and used in this analysis.

### Data processing

Code used to process the cold pool inidcator can be found in the `ecodata` package [here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/data-raw/get_cold_pool.R).
