## Impact Summary

Description of why this indicator is important and what is going on in the Northeast related to this information. 

### Plotted data 

The plot below was built using the code found
[here](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/blob/master/chunk-scripts/LTL.Rmd-cold_pool.R). 

```{r ,  fig.cap = "Cold Pool Index", fig.align="center", eval=T, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir, "/cold_pool_area.png"))
```

### Raw data 
The raw data is available in the [`ecodata` package](https://noaa-edab.github.io/ecodata/landing_page).
